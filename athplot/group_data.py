    This class contains a collection of BinaryData objects which all correspond to the
    same dataset at the same time. This is designed to make it easier to manipulate
    datasets with variables spanning multiple output files. For example, DynGRMHD datasets
    will store the metric in ADM output and the magnetic field in a primitive or conserved
    output, so computing b^2/rho will require both the primitive and ADM outputs.
